      <h2 style="color:#FF3C3C;">Lesson 1: Numerical derivative and integration</h2>
        <p>Here, we learn how to numerically evaluate derivatives and integration.</p>
      <hr>
      <section>
        <h2>Lesson 1-1: Numerical derivative</h2>
	<p>First, we learn a numerical method to evaluate the derivative \(f'(x) \). Before starting a practical programing, we revisit the mathematical operation of the derivative. The derivative of a function \( f(x) \) is defined as the following limit,
	  \[ f'(x)= \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}. \]
	  Therefore, with a small but finite \(h \), one may approximate the derivative \(f'(x) \) as
	  \[f'(x) \approx \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}. \tag{1} \]
	  This approximation is called <i>finite difference method</i>. One can straightforwardly estimate the error in the finite difference method with the Taylor expansion
	  \[f(x+h) = f(x) + f'(x)h +O(h^2). \tag{2}\]
	  One can rewrite Eq. (\(2\)) as
	  \[f'(x) = \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}+O(h). \]
	  Hence, the error of the finite difference formula, Eq. (\(1\)), is propotional to \(h\), \(O(h)\). Therefore, one may accurately evaluate the derivative, \(f'(x)\), by using the small value for \(h\).
	</p>
	<p>
	  One may further develop a more accurate finite difference method based on the Taylor expansion. Here, we consider the Taylor expansion of \(f(x+h)\) and \(f(x-h)\) as
	  \[f(x+h) = f(x) + f'(x)h + \frac{1}{2}f''(x)h^2 + O(h^3), \tag{3}\]
	  \[f(x-h) = f(x) - f'(x)h + \frac{1}{2}f''(x)h^2 + O(h^3). \tag{4}\]
	  By taking difference of Eq. (\(3\)) and Eq. (\(4\)), one may obtain
	  \[f'(x) = \frac{f(x+h)-f(x-h)}{2h} +O(h^2). \tag{5}\]
	  Remarkabely, the error of the finite defference formula, Eq. (\(5\)), is propotional to \(h^2\). Hence, the finite difference formula in Eq. (\(5\)) can be more accurate than Eq. (\(1\)) since the error of Eq. (\(5\)) is rapidly converged to zero. The finite difference formula in Eq. (\(1\)) is called <i>forward finite difference</i> while the fomula in Eq. (\(5\)) is callsed <i>central finite difference</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  In this section, we learn the numerical derivative with the forward finite difference and central finite difference. As a practive example, we consider the derivative of the exponetional function \(f(x)=e^x\) at \( x=0 \). In the following code, we compute the derivative, \( f'(0) \), by changing the finite difference, \(h\), and evaluate the error of the finite difference method. Here, the error is defined as the absolute value of the derivation of the numerical derivative from the exact value, \( Error = \left|f'_{numerical}(0)-f'_{exact}(0) \right| \).

	<pre><code>program main
  implicit none
  integer :: i, n
  real(8) :: ff_0, ff_p, ff_m, dfdx_f, dfdx_m, dfdx_e
  real(8) :: x, h

  x = 0d0
  dfdx_e = exp(x)
  
  h = 1d0
  
  n = 16
  open(20,file="fd_error.out")
  do i = 1, n
     ff_0   = exp(x)
     ff_p = exp(x+h)
     ff_m = exp(x-h)

     dfdx_f = (ff_p-ff_0)/h
     dfdx_m = (ff_p-ff_m)/(2d0*h)

     write(20,"(5e16.6e3)")h,dfdx_f,abs(dfdx_f - dfdx_e),dfdx_m,abs(dfdx_m - dfdx_e)
     
     h = h/2d0
  end do
  close(20)

  
end program main</code></pre>
	<p>
	  In the above program, we compute the derivative at \(x=0\). Hence, the valuable <code>x</code> is prepared as <code>x=0</code>. Then, we compute the exact value of the derivative as <code>dfdx_e = exp(x)</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  To output the results into a file, we open the file with <code>open</code>. Here, we use the following line:
	  <pre><code>open(20,file="fd_error.out")</code></pre>
	  Here, <code>20</code> indicates the unit number, and you can use any natural number here. With <code>file="fd_error.out"</code>, we open a file whose name is <code>fd_error.out</code>. So, in the above statement, the file <code>fd_error.out</code> is opened, and it is assigned to the unit number of <code>20</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  After the <code>open</code> statement, we start the <code>do</code> loop in which we repeat the computation of the numerical derivative by changing the finite defference spacing \(h\). First, we evaluate the functions, \( \exp(x) \), \( \exp(x+h) \) and \( \exp(x-h) \) as <code>ff_0</code>, <code>ff_p</code> and <code>ff_m</code>, respectively. Then, we evaluate the derivative of the function with the forward finite difference, Eq. (\(1\)), as <code>dfdx_f</code>. We also evaluate the derivative with the central finite difference, Eq. (\(5\)), as <code>dfdx_f</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Finally, we output the results by the <code>write</code> statement:
	  <pre><code>write(20,"(5e16.6e3)")h,dfdx_f,abs(dfdx_f - dfdx_e),dfdx_m,abs(dfdx_m - dfdx_e)</code></pre>
	  Here, the <code>write</code> statement writes the results into the file of <code>fd_error.out</code>, which is assigned to the unit number of <code>20</code>. In the <code>write</code> statement, the output format is defiend after the unit number as <code>"5e16.6e3"</code>. Here, the first number <code>5</code> means to output five varioubles. After that <code>e</code> means to use the exponent format. Then, <code>16.6</code> means that the width of each variable is set to <code>16</code> digits and <code>6</code> digits is used to output the significant digits. You can see the actual outout results after executing this program later.
	</p>
	<p>
	  At the end of the <code>do</code> loop, the spacing <code>h</code> for the finite difference is halved, and the program repeat the above procedure with the halved spacing.
